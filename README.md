### Installation:
For `ddml` to run, you need to download the `ddml` repository and add the folder 
to the `adopath`, for example:
```
adopath + "/Users/kahrens/MyProjects/ddml"
```

You also need to run the do file `lddml.do`:
```
run "/Users/kahrens/MyProjects/ddml/lddml.do"
```
This is required to define Mata structures that the package
relies on. 

You will also need `pylearn2` for full functionality:
```
adopath + "/Users/kahrens/MyProjects/pylearn2"
```
